# Coding Memory Flip
A meomory flip game that has code syntax to match. when a match is made a pop up window will display a tip or explination of the syntax like a flash card. The game is won or completed when you clear the board. you will have 3 chances or lives to clear the board and complete the game.

### Motivation
I wanted to make a game that would also include some learning aspect of software engineering to better my knowledge retention along with any users.

### Credits
I got the Idea of a Flip game because I noticed one on Codepen. It was made by Tom Hunt: https://codepen.io/tomhunt/pen/abmLGqE. I thought a game like this might be within my current coding capability and development timeframe capeabilities.
